- Try horizontal platforms (still swinging) as a novel approach to breakout.
	What if we link a pulley to the bell-ringing?
Change all bells to a single color?


The game is starting to take shape (lolz).
I get a feeling of a protagonist other than the bells, as the swinging could occur in the background.
Chandeliers, maybe.

- Swinging and smashing against a solid tower is ALMOST fun.
Would be better if that impact would make objects fall from its top (after a slight, comical delay)
	- have a single tower object
	- have a variable for all obj_Barriers which points to the objects to throw
	
	EXAMPLE ROOM : GurlInDaTower
	
- Bouncing against BounceBarriers can snap the string quickly.
	Learn to release the swing before hitting the surface, so as to bounce gently off of it.
	EXAMPLE ROOM : BounceSnap
	
- Snap so as to land on top of a pile of crates, watch it topple
	EXAMPLE ROOM : LandOnTower
