- Try horizontal platforms (still swinging) as a novel approach to breakout.
	What if we link a pulley to the bell-ringing?
Change all bells to a single color?

The game is starting to take shape (lolz).
I get a feeling of a protagonist other than the bells, as the swinging could occur in the background
as the camera follow another object.
Chandeliers, maybe

- Chandelier swings to one side. Mice/Rats await on the platform ledge, jump when the chandelier gets close.
	Swing to the other side and snap so as to slide to the next part of the level, taking control of another chandelier
	
	in the walls between "rooms"
