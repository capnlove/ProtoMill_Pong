- Swinging and smashing against a solid tower is ALMOST fun.
Would be better if that impact would make objects fall from its top (after a slight, comical delay)
	- have a single tower object
	- have a variable for all obj_Barriers which points to the objects to throw
	
	EXAMPLE ROOM : GurlInDaTower
	
- Bouncing against BounceBarriers can snap the string quickly.
	Learn to release the swing before hitting the surface, so as to bounce gently off of it.
	EXAMPLE ROOM : BounceSnap
	
- Snap so as to land on top of a pile of crates, watch it topple
	EXAMPLE ROOM : LandOnTower
	
- What if you're a mouse in the rafters, switching pendulum/bell/chandelier by travelling the space between
	rooms
	EXAMPLE ROOM : Rat Race

- Simple, hit targets on both ends of the swinging arc
	Maybe it unlocks a new level, maybe it triggers something, etc.
	- Sequences (Left Left Right) would allow players to practice precision swinging and counter balance
	EXAMPLE ROOM : CloseTargets
	
- Targets could also require snap to hit, which makes them a one-shot deal (unless multiple bells)
	EXAMPLE ROOM : DistantTargets
